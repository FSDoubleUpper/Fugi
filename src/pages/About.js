                Hi there! My name is Yao and I'm a Full Stack developer. When
                I'm not busy bringing my code to life, you can find me behind
                the lens of a camera, indulging in some video game action, or of
                course, programming to my heart's content. I'm passionate about
                programming because it allows me to take the ideas swirling
                around in my head and turn them into something tangible and
                real. Whether it's a new app or a website, programming gives me
                the tools to bring my visions to life and share them with the
                world. So if you're in need of some top-notch code or just want
                to chat about the latest and greatest in the tech world, don't
                hesitate to reach out!
            </p>
